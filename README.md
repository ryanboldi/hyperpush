# hyperpush

Based heavily on The Hypercube-based NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies ([HyperNEAT](http://eplex.cs.ucf.edu/hyperNEATpage/)), hyperpush is a package for evolving indirect encodings for neural networks.

A previous project, [pushgp-art](https://github.com/ryanboldi/pushgp-art) uses the same indirect encoding concept to encode black and white images. This package utilizes indirect encodings as a representation of the connectivity patterns of a neural network, as opposed to image pixel values.
